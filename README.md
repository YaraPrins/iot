# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This repository is meant as an overview, a journal and will serve its purpose for writing down assignments given to me by the class I'm following for my undergrad study.
I'm currently a student at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam.
This repository is especially for the class Internet of Things (IoT), and for that reason I may sometimes refer in my texts to "my assigment" or "the assignment".

## About ðŸ¦„

In this repository you will find some folders, with names like "Manual 1". These refer to one of my assignments, and in those folders I have made some README's with more information.
The README's are meant as some sort of manual, on how to do certain things (in Manual 1 I'm trying to connect a NodeMCU board to the Arduino software, to light up a LED strip with my phone through WiFi).
I hope you'll learn somethings from my experiences, and have a good day (or night, depending when you're reading this)!
