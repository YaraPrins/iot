# Adafruit IO
Adafruit IO is a library for Arduino, used with Internet of Things. With this library you can put sensordata online (with help of the MQTT protocol) in a "feed", where you can use your actuators through the web.

# Quickstart

## General Installation
To use Adafruit IO, you need to have done a couple of things.

1. You need to have Arduino installed, and connected to a board that can send out and receive WiFi. (i.e. NodeMCU, which I will be using today).
2. Your board should be correctly installed and adapted to the Arduino software.
3. You need to have a working internet connection.
4. You need to have some device or piece that is considered 'smart', for example a Philips Hue lightbulb.

## Installing Adafruit IO
From there, you need to install the Adafruit IO library in your Arduino software by going to your Library Manager, typing in Adafruit IO Arduino and install your prefered version (there are multiple, each with their own perks, so look for your own preferences).
