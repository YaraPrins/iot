# Manual 2 - Arduino, NodeMCU & Telegram

## ðŸ“± Telegram
Telegram is a globally accessible freemium, cross-platform, cloud-based instant messaging (IM) service. The service also provides optional end-to-end encrypted chats and video calling, VoIP, file sharing and several other features. (- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)))

## ðŸ“” Quickstart

### âš™ General Installation
To get started, you need to have done a couple of things.

1. You need to have Arduino installed, and connected to a board that can send out and receive WiFi. (i.e. NodeMCU, which I will be using today).
2. Your board should be correctly installed and adapted to the Arduino software. This includes selecting the right board and port in your Arduino.

Make sure you have installed the board by going to Tools > Board> Board Manager, and look for "esp". Select `esp8266` by ESP8266 Community and install any version above `3.**`.
To then select that board and the port you are using, go to Tools > Board `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)`, and Tools > Port > `COM3` (Windows) or `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART` (macOS).
3. You need to have a working internet connection.
4. You need to have a Telegram account
5. I'm using a LED strip today to control the colors, but you can also just make a chatbot or something like that

### âœ” Telegram Bot
From there you need to follow a couple of steps to get started before you get to coding.

#### BotFather

1. We're now first off all going to set up your bot in Telegram. So, make sure you have a Telegram account, and either access through Telegram Web or through the IOS/Android App. 
2. When you're logged in, go to the searchbar at the top of the screen and tpye in "BotFather".
3. Select the BotFather user and tap the start button at the bottom of the screen, or write `/start` in the chat.
4. After the welcoming message, type in `/newbot`, to create a new bot for your own.
5. BotFather will ask you to come up with a name. Fill in your prevered name and continue.
6. Then you need to choose a username for your bot, ending with "bot" or "_bot". It can take a bit because some are already taken (in that case you will get notified by BotFather).
7. When you're finished up with the name and username, BotFather will generate a token for you. Note or copy the token, it will be used in the code! (also make sure to never upload the token to GitHub or something, for privacy reasons of course).
8. Tap the start button at the bottom of the screen (I did this on IOS / Android app, I couldn't get it to work on my desktop).

#### Arduino Libraries

Now we have made our Telegram Bot, but before we can do anything with it on Arduino, we need to install a couple of Arduino Libraries to make sure the code runs smoothly.

The libraries you need to have installed:

- ArduinoJSON by Benoit Blanchon (version 5.13.5 , v6 is still in beta and not yet compatible with Telegram)
- CTBot by Stefano Ledda

and in my case because I am working with Adafruit Neopixel for my LED strip
- Adafruit NeoPixel by Adafruit


## Connecting your Telegram Bot to Arduino

### The Code

We will use one of the example codes from the CTBot library called `lightBot`. Go to File > Examples > CTBOT > lightBot, and select it. This will open up a new window.

### Setting Up
In the string `ssid` you need to fill in your WiFi network name, and in the string `pass` please fill in your WiFi password (don't worry, as long as you dont upload your code online, no one can hack your WiFi ;) ). Then, next up is the string `token`, please paste your Telegram Bot token you received earlier.

After filling in your general info that is needed, I will in my case also be declaring some extra things in this code. I am using a LED strip and the library Adafruit Neopixel to control the lights of my LED with the Telegram bot. So, on the top of my code, just beneath the 
```
#include "CTBot.h"
CTBot myBot;
``` 
part, I will write this too, to include the Adafruit library:

```
// LED STRIP ADAFRUIT
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
#ifdef __AVR__
 #include <avr/power.h> // Required for 16 MHz Adafruit Trinket
#endif

#define LED_PIN D5
#define LED_COUNT 15

// Declare our NeoPixel strip object:
Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(LED_COUNT, LED_PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);
// Argument 1 = Number of pixels in NeoPixel strip
// Argument 2 = Arduino pin number (most are valid)
// Argument 3 = Pixel type flags, add together as needed:
//   NEO_KHZ800  800 KHz bitstream (most NeoPixel products w/WS2812 LEDs)
//   NEO_KHZ400  400 KHz (classic 'v1' (not v2) FLORA pixels, WS2811 drivers)
//   NEO_GRB     Pixels are wired for GRB bitstream (most NeoPixel products)
//   NEO_RGB     Pixels are wired for RGB bitstream (v1 FLORA pixels, not v2)
//   NEO_RGBW    Pixels are wired for RGBW bitstream (NeoPixel RGBW products)

```

This part of the code is based off on the example code `strandtest` from the library Adafruit Neopixel, with slight changes (my LED_PIN is D5 instead of 6, because my ledstrip is connected to the pin D5, and my LED_COUNT is 15, the amount of LEDs I have on my LED strip).

After writing this, I also changed the original lightBot code a bit, under the strings for your WiFi and Telegram Token, instead of `uint8_t led = 2` or `uint8_t led = BUILTIN_LED`, I made sure to connect it with my LED strip by putting `uint8_t led = LED_PIN`, so basically that means that my `uint8_led` is connected to pin D5 of my NodeMCU board.


## ðŸ™‹ My installation process

### ðŸ’­ First thoughts
It wasn't that hard luckily to make it work with the build in LED light from my NodeMCU board, but it was relatively tricky to get it working with my LED strip. Although I did get it to work, I think if I have a bit more understanding of how C++ and Arduino works, I would have made faster and more progress than relatively simple code that I have used here.

### ðŸ”Œ Bot with LED strip
After the Telegram Bot has been made, and I had it connected it to Arduino, I started by checking out the example code and tried to understand what they meant and wrote. It was pretty straight forward and soon I got what they wrote. I tested it on my phone with the Telegram app, but at first the bot wouldn't respond, it didn't turn the light on or off and didn't send out a message back...

This was quite odd, because I was certain that I connected it correctly, so I tried again, pasted the token again, but yet with no success. Then I tried to use my actual WiFi instead of my mobile WiFi hotspot, and then it suddenly worked!

### ðŸ’¾ Writing the code
First I only worked with the build in light from the board, and it eventually worked, but now I wanted to control my LED strip.

When I made sure that my Telegram Bot worked with the initial commands, I started to change it around a bit by adding a third `else if` statement, stating that if the incoming text to the bot was `color to red`, it needed to put the color of the light to red.

Here is where it started to get really tricky. Because I wasn't sure how to connect my LED strip to this chatbot code. But, then I remembered that I have a library on my arduino called `Arduino NeoPixel`, which uses the LED strip. So, I opened up an example code from that, and added some of that code into my original lightBot code (see above for set up). After setting this up correctly, I also put this into my `void setup(){}` code

```
  // These lines are specifically to support the Adafruit Trinket 5V 16 MHz.
  // Any other board, you can remove this part (but no harm leaving it):
  // #if defined(__AVR_ATtiny85__) && (F_CPU == 16000000)
    // clock_prescale_set(clock_div_1);
  // #endif
    // END of Trinket-specific code.

    strip.begin();           // INITIALIZE NeoPixel strip object (REQUIRED)
    strip.show();            // Turn OFF all pixels ASAP
    strip.setBrightness(50); // Set BRIGHTNESS to about 1/5 (max = 255)
```

This makes sure to set up the LED strip once when you start up your code.

Then, in my loop code, I put some code into my `if` statements, where I first of all put in (in my `if` statement for `CTBotMessageText == myBot.getNewMessage(msg)) {}`)
```
		if (msg.text.equalsIgnoreCase("LIGHT ON")) {              
			strip.fill((255,255,255), 0, 0);                              
			myBot.sendMessage(msg.sender.id, "Light is now ON");
		}
		}
```

which worked, but the lights turned blue instead of my intended white.
I also tried to add a 'turn color to red' `if` statement, but this wouldnt work for some reason. I did the same as above, but instead of `strip.fill((255,255,255), 0, 0)` (first the color, then the starting point and lastly how many lights to be affected), I put in `strip.fill((255,0,0), 0, 0)` for it to be filled in with red. But, this code didn't work. 

Note: it did send a message afterwards that it turned to red, but the color of the LED strip turned off instead of to red.

I couldn't understand why this was happening, and got really frustrated. After a bit of looking on the web, I tried this instead of `string.fill`:

```
if (msg.text.equalsIgnoreCase("LIGHT ON")) {
      for (int i = 0; i<strip.numPixels(); i++) {
          strip.setPixelColor(i, 50, 50, 50);
      }              // if the received message is "LIGHT ON"..
      strip.show();                                // turn on the LED (inverted logic!)
			myBot.sendMessage(msg.sender.id, "Light is now ON");  // notify the sender
		}
```

So instead of the fill property, I used `setPixelColor`, with a `for` statement with an `int i` to say i is the number of the pixel on the ledstrip. In this piece of code above I'm stating that as long as i is below the total number of pixels on the strip, increase the i, and run this next code.

With this change, my code did work! And also in the correct colors! As last part of this journey I also added an `if` statement for the colors green and blue, and these worked perfectly fine!
